# OPLE

## [Link to the deployed project here](https://playful-longma-e9a70b.netlify.app/)
Created a Wordle clone with CSS, JS, and HTML and made it to where all the words in the wordle are all one piece related (hence the name)
Just a little side note. When I started this project, I started using WordsAPI to check if all words submitted were actual words, but obviously, the names and places of one piece are not actual English words, so I had to abandon the idea.
